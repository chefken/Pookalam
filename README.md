# ðŸŒ¸ Pookalam â€“ A Digital Mandala with p5.js

> A mesmerizing fusion of art and code â€“ this project recreates the beauty of **Pookalam** (traditional floral mandalas from Kerala) in a digital form, using pure **p5.js** and **HTML**.

## âœ¨ Why This Project?
Pookalam is traditionally crafted during **Onam**, the harvest festival of Kerala, symbolizing joy, unity, and creativity.  
This project is my attempt to **bring that cultural vibrance to the digital world**, blending **geometry, symmetry, and glowing gradients** into a code-driven mandala.
